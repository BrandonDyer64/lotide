# lotide
An attempt at a federated forum / link aggregator using ActivityPub.
It is intended to eventually federate with projects like [Lemmy](https://github.com/lemmynet/lemmy), but it seems Lemmy [isn't ready for that](https://todo.sr.ht/~vpzom/lotide/8).

To track progress and report issues, visit the [issue tracker](https://todo.sr.ht/~vpzom/lotide).

See [hitide](https://git.sr.ht/~vpzom/hitide) for the frontend code.

## Test/Demo Instances
Might disappear or get wiped occasionally.
