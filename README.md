# lotide
An attempt at a federated forum / link aggregator using ActivityPub.
It is intended to eventually federate with projects like [Lemmy](https://github.com/lemmynet/lemmy), but it's [not there yet](https://todo.sr.ht/~vpzom/lotide/8).

See [hitide](https://git.sr.ht/~vpzom/hitide) for the frontend code.
